# GCC-Cloud-Compiler
GCC-Cloud Compiling for advanced and fast (emulated) C++ Support Scripts.

## Usage

- Execute the Server-Script on a running instance. Edit the Key-Variable and add a (safe!) one. I recommend my tool Safe-Cryption (e.g. movement) to generate a 256-Bit string.
- Set the HOST-Value to your IP-Adress in the Client-Script
- Optional: Change the port.


At the moment there can only be send one CPP-Script without required input.
More coming soon.

## Trouble-Shooting

- Check the Port-Connection
- Exact same Key has to be on client and server side

## Security-Notice

There are a few security issues within the server-instance at the moment. I higly recommend running this script
only in LAN Networks, that are not public accessible.
